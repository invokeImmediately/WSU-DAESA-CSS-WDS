# WSU-DAESA-CSS-WDS
This is a front-end development project for producing CSS source files used on [WSU DAESA](https://daesa.wsu.edu/) websites running the [Web Design System (WDS) theme](https://github.com/wsuwebteam/wsuwp-theme-wds) in WSU WordPress. This project is designed to produce CSS for application to websites through the WSUWP theme's CSS Stylesheet Editor interface working in add-on mode. Style rules in this project are written in the [Less language extension of CSS](https://lesscss.org/#overview) and intended to be compiled into CSS using [Gulp workflow automation](https://gulpjs.com/) and the [gulp-less plugin for Gulp](https://github.com/gulp-community/gulp-less). It is assumed that this project will be incorporated into other front-end development projects as a submodule so that developers can combine its code with code from their own source files.
